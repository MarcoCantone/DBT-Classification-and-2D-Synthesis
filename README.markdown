# ü©ª DBT-Classification-and-2D-Synthesis üñºÔ∏è

The DBT-Classification-and-2D-Synthesis is a framework that simultaneously 
performs **classification** and **synthesizes a diagnostic 2D representation from 3D DBT volumes** 

## üíª Script Execution Guide

This framework requires a dedicated **YAML configuration file** for each executable script. <br>
Example configuration files are provided for each specific use case.

1) _experiment_attnnet.py_: **trains and evaluates the 3D model**. 
Although not directly related to the proposed method, this script is required 
to build and/or evaluate the source 3D model used for synthetic image generation
(for either training or inference purposes).
The behavior of the script depends on the number of training epochs specified: <br>
	‚Ä¢	Epochs > 0 ‚Üí training mode <br>
	‚Ä¢	Epochs = 0 ‚Üí evaluation mode (i.e., inference on the test set) <br>
[Configuration File](configs/config.yaml) <br>


2) _experiment_2Dsyn.py_: **trains and evaluates the 2D model**.
Although not directly related to the proposed method, this script is required 
to build and/or evaluate the source 2D model, which is trained and tested on synthetic 2D images 
generated by the 3D model.
The script‚Äôs behavior depends on the number of training epochs set: <br>
    ‚Ä¢	Epochs > 0 ‚Üí training mode <br>
    ‚Ä¢	Epochs = 0 ‚Üí evaluation mode (i.e., inference on the defined test set) <br>
[Configuration File](configs/config_2D.yaml)


3) _saliency.py_: **generates 2D synthetic images using a pre-trained 3D model**.
This script was specifically designed for use with the OMI-DB dataset. <br>
[Configuration File](configs/config_saliency.yaml) 


4) _saliency_BCS.py_: **generates 2D synthetic images using a pre-trained 2D model**.
This script was specifically developed for the BCS-DBT dataset. <br>
[Configuration File](configs/config_saliency_BCS.yaml) 


5) _saliency_metrics.py_: **computes image similarity metrics such as SSIM and LPIPS**.
This script is intended for use with samples that include ground truth bounding boxes 
(as in the BCS-DBT case).
It will not function correctly without properly defined ground truth bounding boxes. <br>
